Ouroboros Queue: Circular Single Linked Queue Structure

Code/Slide Show demonstrating the circular single linked Queue Structure in Python, GoLang, and C.

I named this structure an Ouroboros Queue (classic serpent eating its tail in circle) due to the Queue object field tail pointing to the head rather than the normal method of keeping both a head and tail pointer in the Queue object.
