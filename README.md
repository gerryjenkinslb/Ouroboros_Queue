Ouroboros Queue: Circular Single Linked Queue Structure

Code/Slide Show demonstrating the circular single linked Queue Structure in C and Python.

This structure is named a Ouroboros Queue due to the tail pointing to the head rather than the normal method of keeping both a head and tail pointer in the Queue object.
